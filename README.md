# Gadgets-Scala
I wanted to learn something new so I decided to completely rewrite the existing EveGadgets program in Scala{Play, Slick, Angular}. So far I've discovered that collections are VERY fun to work with and that Spring is much better at jsonification than Play. 
Current plans are that all future development to Gadgets goes here.

# PROBABLY HOW TO GET THIS THING RUNNING 
1.  Go to fuzzworks SDD and get invtypes, invgroups, invmarketgroups, invtypematerials, planetschematics, and planetschematicstypemap
2.  Get planetsetupstorage from https://github.com/Kurt-Midas/EveGadgets/tree/master/sql
3.  Create a MySQL db on localhost:3306/eve with root:MySQLPass (this can be changed in application.conf). Add all above tables.
4.  ??? (libraries and stuff. Java 8, maven, etc)
5.  console to the directory and type "activator run"
